# Cozo-Engine
## What is Cozo Engine?
Cozo Engine is an open source Game Engine that we'er currently working on :eyes:
There is not much in the engine but i hope it will get better.
We're using c++ and opengl (glut) to make this engine!

## Any Plans?
Well yes, as we said, we're currently working on it, I will put some <todo's> here later.
